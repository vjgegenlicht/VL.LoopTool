## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Disclaimer ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ 

Looptool is my personal attempt to make my own creative process as easy and fun as possible. 
At this stage of development im still trying to define and create the toolset that fits this purpose.
Breaking changes will be very common for the animation node set. I will do my best to keep the recording as consistent as i can.
